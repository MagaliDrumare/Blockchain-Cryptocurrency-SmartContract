What is Bitcoin? 

-> Technology : BlockChain 
-> Protocol : How participants of Bitcoin Network are working?
	-Waves Ethereum Bitcoin Neo Ripple Monero. 
	-Each of this protocol have a coin.
-> Tokens (ICO) : rely on smart contracts which are built on the top of different protocols. 
	-For example in ethereum : hundreds of token 
	TRX, REP, RHOC, PPT, AE, SNT, MKR, BNB
	-No tokens on bitcoin, ripple.

-> Bitcoin created by Satoshi Nakamoto 
	-People can make transactions even if they don't know each other. 
	-Remove the bank intermediary

-> The Bitcoin Ecosystem: 
	-Nodes : people who want to make transaction 
	-Miners : add block to the blockchain 
	-Large Mines : miners with a lot of power 
	-Mining pool : when miners get together to work

-> The Halving 
	-Total of bitcoins in circulation ever: 21 Million Bitcoin by 2140. 
	-Block reward is divided by two every 20000 bitcoins.
	-But the fees for mining are increasing. 
	-Transaction fees are meant to remplace block rewards. 
	-Deflationary system. 

->  Block Frequency 
	-In average a bitcoin is mined every ten minutes 


Understanding Mining Difficulty. 

-> How is the current Target 
	-> Current target 18 leading zeros 
	-> Propability of possible hashes = 16exp64 = 10exp77
	-> Probability of total valid hashes (with 18 leading zeros)= 2X10exp55
	Probability of total valid hashes is nothing compared to Propability of possible hashes.
	-> Probability that a randomly picked is valid : 
	2x10exp-22 less chance of winning lottery. 

-> How is 'Mining Difficulty' calculated? 
-> Difficulty = current/ max target 
-> Difficulty is adjusted every 2 weeks 
-> How much is hard to mine compared to the very start. 
-> Difficulty is adjusted by the None itself.

Mining Pools
-> Mining pools are groups of cooperating miners who agree to share block rewards in proportion to their contributed mining hash power.
-> Miners combine their hashing power. 
-> Distributed the nonce among the different nodes.

Nonce Range 
-> Nonce 32-bit number between 0 and 4 billion 
-> Timestamp : +1 every second the miner has access to the whole range of Nonce. 
-> A miner alone never reach the limit of 4 billion thanks the Timestamp process. Not the case for a mining pool. (1)


How miners pick their transaction? part 1 
-> Transactions appear in a MEMPOOL.
-> Transaction id and fees. 
-> The miner chooses the high fees transaction. If the transaction is not high enough => rejected. 
-> (1) Solution: Change the block configuration. Change the data. 
remove a transaction and choose another transaction. 


How miners pick their transaction? part 2 
-> Average block size 1 MB (mega bytes)
-> A lot of transactions, the fees increase. 
(december 2017)
-> BTC.com : accelerator of transaction. If you want to accelerate you transaction you have to pay an extra fee.

CPU's vs GPU's vs ASIC's 
-> CPU = central processing unit-general <10MH/s
-> GPU = graphics processing unit-specialized matrix and graph <1GH/s
-> ASIC = Application Specific Integrated Circuit-totally specialized 
>1000 GH/s 
-> Cloud Mining development. 
-> With Ethereum only use a GPU not Asic. (Ethereum needs to access memory)
-> When comparing two processors : compare the H/s between to processors for only one Cryptocurrency. 


How do Mempools work? 
-> Mining of the block with transactions -> block added to the blockchain in each node and transactions 
remove from the Mempool of each node. 


Orphan blocks 
-> Detached orphaned blocks are valid blocks which are part of the main chain. 
-> Important to wait for 6 confirmations for your transaction to be successful. 
-> Which block result to be part of the longer chain. 


51% Attack
-> 51% of the hash rate
-> Mining without distribution to the network -> They have more hashing power and the chain becomes longer. 
-> And at the end publication of the longest chain and they keep their assets Ferrari yatch, other coins without paying them because the transaction are cancelled.
