Blockchain Intuition 

What's is blockchain ? 
-> A blockchain is a continously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography.
-> Each block is composed of data, hash and prevous hash (the hash of the previous block) => blocks are cryptographically linked together. 
-> Key concepts associated with Blockchain : Mining, Concensus Protocol, Hash Cryptography, Distributed P2P Network, Immutable Ledger. 

Understanding SHA256-Hash 
-> https://tools.superdatascience.com/blockchain/hash
-> Digital finger print of a document created by the NSA. 
-> 64 characters long. 
-> It's a hexadecimal hash, it has a numbers from 0 to 9 and letters A B C D E F G H I.....Z
-> Same data => same hash / same finger print. 
-> Change a little the data => big effect. 
-> 5 requirements for Hash algorithms 
	-one way (no reverse engineering)
	-deterministic (same result)
	-fast computation 
	-avalanche effect (little change in data/ big change in algorithm)
	-must withstand collisions 

Imnmutable Ledger 
-> Any time we need a consensus about facts, we use a ledger. Ledgers record the facts underpinning the modern economy.
-> Use of Blackchain for property, diamonds, art transactions. 
-> If you want to change one block, all the chain after this block is no longer valid. 
-> Blockchain must replace traditional ledger (ex : Haiti)

Distributed P2P network 
-> The blockchain is distributed between different nodes. 
-> Each node has a copy of the blockchain. 
-> If a blck is attacked on a node, the others nodes will restore the blockchain corrupted. 


How Mining works : Nonce? part 1 
-> A block is made of : 
	- a block name 
	- a nonce (number)
	- data : not only one transaction. 
	-previous hash 
	-hash 
-> The nonce allows to monitore the hash. 
-> If you change the nonce, you change the hash. 


How mining works : Nonce part 2 
Hash is an hexadecimal number of 64 bits 
-> Le système hexadécimal nécessite l'introduction de 16 symboles, représentant les 16 premiers entiers naturels : 0 ; 1 ; 2 ; 3 ; 4 ; 5 ; 6 ; 7 ; 8 ; 9 ; A ; B ; C ; D ; E ; F.
A => 10 ; B=> 11; C=>12, D=13; E =>14, F=>15

-> binaire	1.0101.1010.1010.1100.1111.0111
->  regroupé par 4	  1 	  0101 	  1010 	  1010 	  1100 	  1111 	  0111
->  regroupé en hexadécimal 	  1 	 5	 A	 A	 C	 F	 7
-> hexadécimal	15AACF7 
-> decimal   (Décimal)	22719735

-> If the miner finds a hash below the target ('0000') -> validation of the algorithm. 

-> Can't change name of the block, the data, prev Hash => change the Nonce. 

-> The miner is change the nonce to find the right nonce that will generate the hash below the target => The Golden nonce. 
Then the first that is finding the Nonce wins and validate the block=> add the block to the blockchain.


Byzantine Fault Tolerance 
-> Decentralized system : Concensus protocol fault tolerant. 
-> Blockchain, airplane, rocket, nuclear powerplant system. 
-> The Byzantine Generals Problem : https://medium.com/all-things-ledger/the-byzantine-generals-problem-168553f31480


Concensus Protocol : defense against Attackers 
-> Attackers : a bad node added at the end of the blockchain.
-> Competing chains : two different blocks with different transactions mined and validated at the same time at the end of the chain. 
-> Concensus protocol: 
	->PoW (proof of work) used by Bitcoin and Ethereum 
	->PoS (proof of stake)
	->Other 

# PoW
-> Billion of iterations from the part of the miners to find the right Nonce/ Golden Nonce -> a lot of time and computing power and electricity. 
-> The Hash they obtain at the end (corresponding to the Golden nonce)is the proof of work. 
-> Incentives for the miners: Miner will receive bitcoin/ ethereum when he adds a new block + fees associated to the transaction registred in the block + incentives to play fair to play according to the rules. 


Concesus Protocol : Proof of work(PoW)
-> Groups of nodes who have the majority computing power (more than 50%) have the most chance to validate a block.
-> Junk block are named orphaned block and the transaction fees are not perceived by the miner. 
-> Wait until a couple of transaction have been accepted.
