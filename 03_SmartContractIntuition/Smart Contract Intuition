Smart Contract Intuition 

What is a smart contract 
-> Smart contract is the program that is distributed on the computer. 
-> Each node has : 
-history of the all smart contracts 
-history of all transactions of the smart contract 
-current state of all smart contract (execution)

-> Blockchain : the solution for transparency in product supply chain.

/ What is a Dapps : decentralized Application 
-> Dapp is the frontend 
-> Smart contracts is the backend of the Dapp. 
-> Dapp => allows users to interact with the blockchain 
-> Steemit : twitter on the blockchain.

/Ethereum : Virtual Machine and Gas (security)
-> In Case on the virus on small contracts 
-> Security threats : viruses and access to private files, infinite loops. 
-> Against viruses : EVM Ethereum virtual machine that is running on the computer and no link with the computer. If something go wrong, it's on teh Ethereum Virtual Machine. 
-> Against infinite loops : Gas. For any computation running on the blockchain, the user has to pay. Like Essence to run the car. 
run an addition multiplication = 3 unit of gas. 
-> Code in solidity -> execution code<-> gas. 
-> Write the most efficie: https://ethgasstation.info/
Bitcoin => create cryptocurrency 
Ethereum => network runs on the blockchain. 


/Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAOs)
-> Organization designed in the blockchain with smart contracts. 
-> No human intervention.  
-> To read : https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/


/The DAO Attack 
-> https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/the-dao-the-hack-the-soft-fork-and-the-hard-fork/
-> https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2017-the-ether-thief/
-> Problem not in the blockchain but in the code of the App. 
-> Reverse the funds to the people. 


/ Soft and Hard Forks
-> Due to the DAO attach -> new chain of Ethereum Classic 
-> To increase the number of transactions in a block -> new chain BitchainCash 8MB of transactions. 
-> Keep on mining with GPU -> BitcoinGold. 
-> Hard Fork of the software.
