Cryptocurrency Transactions Intuition 

Transactions and UTXOs 
-> UXTO Unspent transactions output. 
-> An Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) that can be spent as an input in a new transaction.

Where do transaction fees come from? 
-> Fees = Inputs-Outputs 
-> Not converted in UTXO during the transaction. 


How Wallets Work 
-> Combination of the UTXO still available for transaction. 


Signatures : Private and Public Keys 
-> Private key unique identifier. Others don't have access to the private key.
-> Public Key shared with the others
-> Private Key + Message = Signature 
-> Message + Signature + Public key => verification function to validate that the message was signed by the priviate key that generate the public key.

What is segregated Witness (SegWit)
-> 1 megabytes limit of the block size 
-> For each transaction in a block you have 
From : X 
To : Y 
Amount : 0.3 BTC 
Signature : <...>
Public Key : <...> 
-> Signature and public key take 60% of the transaction size. 
-> ScriptSig is externalized in its own massaging channel. In an extended block. 
-> The block is less full but the size is not changing only the space in that block is increasing. 
-> Increase the speed of mining. 

Public Key vs Bitcoin address 
-> Want to keep the public key private.  
-> To obtain the address apply a sha-256 function to the public key. 
-> Use address to receive the cryptocurrency. 
-> The address generated from the public key will appear in the transaction-message of the block. 


Hierarchically Deterministic (HD) Wallet 
-> Each adress has a public key and a private key. 
-> Master Private Key generates few private keys 
-> Master Private Key allows the access to all the address and all the transactions. 
-> Master private key can generate a Master Public Key that can replace each public key generated by a private key generated by the Master private key.   
-> Master Priv Key generates from a memonic write in a paper. 
-> Master Private key can restore all the private key and the public keys.
